## Sort!

All you need to focus on is writing two sorting algorithms. One in ```sorts/insertionSort.js``` and the other in ```sorts/selectionSort.js```.

Open ```index.html``` to see your sorting algorithm played back to you visually:
  - A red flash indicates that an array element has been *written*
  - A green flash indicates that an array element has been *read*

### Deliverables
  - Write insertion and selection sort
  - Understanding that one visual action (either a read or write) is occurring for each array every frame, describe what this is an accurate (and inaccurate) time representation of
  - Provide an explanation for the different speeds of the sorts
  - Provide an explanation for how both changes in array sizes as well as changes in how scrambled the arrays are would affect performance for the sorting algorithms


### Tips
  - Feel free to alter the size of the arrays and duration of the steps in config.js
